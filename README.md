# Astronomical-Objects-Classification

Conducted analysis of astronomical object classification, addressing challenges such as missing values, class imbalance, and severe multi-collinearity. Conducted a comparative analysis between bagging methods (random forests, extra trees) and boosting methods (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), alongside multi-modal DNN and Kernelized SVM, to assess their performance.
